Calll application for Android (discontinued) allows you to disable network connections during a call and re-enable them after the call. In this way, you can save your brain (obviously, not at all) from some types of radiations.
Calll is an open source project and it's free to download; we are looking for developers which would like to help us to improve the application.
Calll is discontinued, but any fork is welcome.
